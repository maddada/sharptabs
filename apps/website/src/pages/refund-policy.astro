                    Our goal is to provide a valuable and enjoyable experience. We understand that sometimes things don't work out
                    as expected, and we've created this policy to explain when you may be eligible for a refund.<br />
                    Our policy is designed to be transparent and fair. Please read it carefully to understand your rights and our obligations.

                <p>
                    For most users, purchases are made through an app store platform like the Apple App Store or the Google Play
                    Store. These platforms act as the merchant of record and have their own robust refund policies and processes.<br
                    />
                    As such, nearly all refund requests must be processed directly through the platform where you made the purchase.
                    We do not have the ability to process refunds for purchases made through Apple or Google.

                <p>
                    While the final decision rests with the app store, here are our general guidelines on what we consider
                    eligible for a refund. You can use these as a reference when submitting your request to Apple or Google.

                                to prevent future charges, and you will retain access to premium features until the end of your current
                                billing period.
