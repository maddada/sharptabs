                <p>
                    Sharp Tabs is designed with your privacy in mind. We do <b>not</b> collect, log, or store any personal
                    data or browsing history. Your information remains on your device and is never sent to the developer.

                <p>
                    Sharp Tabs does <b>not</b> collect any personal or sensitive data. The only data we store is related
                    to your Sharp Tabs account (if you register): your email address, registration date, email verification
                    status, and subscription details. We might also store which features are enabled or disabled in the future.
                    <b>No browsing history, tab details, or personal content is ever collected.</b>

                <p>
                    AI features are available for premium users or anyone using their own Gemini API key. Only the names of your
                    tabs and the beginning of their URLs are sent to Gemini's API to organize your tabs or name a group. <b
                        >Nothing else is sent to Gemini. Nothing is logged or stored. Nothing is ever sent to the
                        developer.</b
                    > You can always toggle off all AI features—they are completely optional.

                <p>
                    Sharp Tabs does <b>not</b> use any installed tracking scripts or third-party cookies. Your browsing activity
                    is never monitored or analyzed.
                    <br />
                    We only optionally Anonymously track the non-sensitive applied settings (once per day max when you close
                    the settings page), this is to get stats about which settings are most used, and help guide development.
                    You can easily toggle this off at any time in the general settings section at the top of the settings
                    page.
